	info = "<p>Hello, Xenobiologists. We hope you enjoy the new shipment of slimes for work. These ones seem to be a little more aggressive than past shipments, so we've provided you with a pair of inert grey cores to begin your work, instead of the usual live grey specimens. Inject them with phoron to get your work started, and stay safe.</p>"
